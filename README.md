# Hi, I'm Yaroslav

I'm junior C++ and C# game developer who is excited to create a game of his dreams. However, now I'm working on my Telegram bot, learning python backend. Also, I really enjoy painting and designing, so I tried my self in creating simple sites on 
JavaScript. I like to learn new things by working on my projects. Unfortunately, I don't have much free time now as I'm studying hard preparing for my exams at school. Nevertheless, I'll continue working on my project when I'm free.

## My Hobbies
- I enjoy drawing. My arts are very simple now as I'm just learning, but I'd like to develop my skills to that level so I can draw any anime character that I like :).
- As you might notice, I'm a fan of anime. I don't watch it very often and there isn't many anime that I like. However, I found that there're many great artits in fandoms and their pictures are awesome.
- Well, I'm also keen on building houses in Minecraft. It's really exciting as I can build a house of my dreams. My favorite styles are modern and Victorians ones. Buildings in these styles look absolutly amazing.
